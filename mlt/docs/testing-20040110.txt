User Acceptance Testing, 2004-01-12, by Dan Dennedy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We may need to add a play u0 in some places of the test script due to play
state issues.
sout u0 1000 made frame 1000 repeat with audio (usta shows playing, not paused).
sin u0 400 made it jump to frame 400 and start playing
When miracle hit the out point (1000) not paused, playing last frame with audio.
Sometimes I need to say goto u0 0 to continue test script because it has hit
the end of a clip.
Everything else working good.
