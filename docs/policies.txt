Open Source Development Policies and Procedures for MLT
by Dan Dennedy

Policies
--------

Any contribution to the "core" module assign copyright to Ushodaya Enterprises
Limited because they need license control over that module.

Comments in the framework and valerie header files must be C-style, not C++.

Procedures
----------

Update services.txt when you add or update a service.

Until we convert to Subversion, which can provide a nice, comprehensive log
please update ChangeLog with every commit.
