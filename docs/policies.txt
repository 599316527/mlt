Open Source Development Policies and Procedures for MLT
by Dan Dennedy

Policies
--------

Any contribution to the "core" module assign copyright to Ushodaya Enterprises
Limited because they need license control over that module.

Comments in the framework and valerie header files must be C-style, not C++.

The framework and valerie client libraries are covered under LGPL. Miracle,
inigo, albino, and humperdink applications are covered under GPL. Modules
should strive to be LGPL to make them available through the framework as LGPL.

Procedures
----------

Update services.txt when you add or update a service.

Until we convert to Subversion, which can provide a nice, comprehensive log
please update ChangeLog with every commit.
