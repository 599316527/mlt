Producers
---------

	avformat

		Description

			ffmpeg libavformat based producer for video and audio.

		Constructor Argument

			'file' - producer a/v from file

		Initialisation Properties

			int video_index - index of video stream to use (-1 is off)
			int audio_index - index of audio stream to use (-1 is off)
			int in - in point
			int out - out point

		Read Only Properties

			double fps - this is fixed at 25 for PAL currently
			double aspect_ratio - this is determined on the first frame read

		Dependencies

			ffmpeg must be configured as --enable-shared and installed prior
			to compilation of mlt.

		Oddities

			There seems to be a discrepancy between audio and video pts (time
			stamps) which causes audio seeking to be unreliable in some cases.
			If audio playback is broken, try adding discrepancy=3 as a
			property.

			Not sure of the exact reasons, but am investigating. 

		Known Bugs

			Fixed frame rate.
			Audio sync discrepancy with some content.
			Not all libavformat supported formats are seekable.
			ogg is currently broken.
			mpeg seeking is inaccurate - doesn't seek to i-frames so you may
			get junk for a few frames.
