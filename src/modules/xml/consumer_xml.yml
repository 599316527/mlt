    title: Process all frames
    type: integer
    description: >
      Without this option, the XML consumer does not process any frames
      and simply serializes the service network. However, some filters (.e.g,
      videostab) require two passes where the first pass performs some
      analysis and stores the result in a property. Therefore, set this
      property to 1 (true) to cause the consumer to process all frames
      before serializing to XML.
